Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques? 
Lasso Regression, short for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator," is a type of linear regression technique used in machine learning and statistics. It differs from other regression techniques, such as linear regression and ridge regression, primarily in how it handles feature selection and regularization.
Key characteristics of Lasso Regression:
Regularization: Like ridge regression, Lasso adds a regularization term to the linear regression cost function. This term penalizes the absolute values of the regression coefficients, encouraging them to be close to zero.
Feature Selection: Lasso has a unique feature: it can effectively perform feature selection by driving the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero. This means that Lasso can automatically identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model.
Ridge Regression vs. Lasso: Both ridge and Lasso regression add regularization terms, but they use different regularization techniques. Ridge uses L2 regularization (sum of squared coefficients), which shrinks all coefficients towards zero but doesn't set them exactly to zero. Lasso uses L1 regularization (sum of absolute coefficients), which can lead to sparse models with exact zeros for some coefficients.
Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection? 
Simplifies Models: Lasso Regression tends to produce sparse models by setting the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero. This results in simpler and more interpretable models with fewer variables to consider.
Improved Model Generalization: By removing irrelevant features, Lasso helps reduce overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits noise in the data, leading to poor generalization to unseen data. Lasso's feature selection mitigates this issue.
Reduces Data Dimensionality: When dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many features, Lasso's feature selection can significantly reduce data dimensionality. This simplification can lead to faster model training and evaluation.
Saves Computational Resources: By excluding irrelevant features, Lasso reduces the computational burden associated with modeling and analysis, as fewer variables need to be processed.
Automatic Feature Selection: Lasso's feature selection process is automated, requiring minimal manual intervention. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you have limited domain knowledge.
Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model? 
Non-Zero Coefficients: In a Lasso model, some coefficients are non-zero, indicating the selected features' importance. These non-zero coefficients represent the features that have a direct impact on the target variable.
Zero Coefficients: Lasso sets the coefficients of less important or irrelevant features to exactly zero. This means that these features are effectively excluded from the model. You can interpret zero coefficients as indicating that those specific features do not contribute to the model's predictions.
Coefficient Magnitudes: The magnitudes of non-zero coefficients represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each selected feature and the target variable. Positive coefficients indicate a positive correlation, while negative coefficients indicate a negative correlation. The larger the coefficient, the greater the impact of that feature on the target variable.
Comparative Interpretation: When comparing the magnitudes of non-zero coefficients, you can assess which features have a more substantial influence on the target variable. Features with larger coefficients have a stronger impact, while those with smaller coefficients have a relatively weaker influence.
Significance: Unlike standard linear regression, where all coefficients have non-zero values, Lasso regression forces some coefficients to be exactly zero. This indicates that the model has deemed certain features as statistically insignificant or irrelevant in explaining the target variable's variance.
Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the  model's performance? 
Lambda (Alpha) Parameter: The lambda parameter controls the strength of L1 regularization in Lasso Regression. It determines how much the coefficients are penalized for their absolute values. A larger lambda value results in stronger regularization, while a smaller lambda value reduces regularization.
Scaling of Features: Scaling or standardizing features can indirectly influence Lasso's behavior. Features with different scales can have varying impact on the regularization process. Scaling ensures that all features are treated equally in terms of regularization.
Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how? 
Lasso Regression is primarily designed for linear regression problems, where the relationship between the features and the target variable is assumed to be linear. However, it can be adapted for non-linear regression problems with some modifications. Here are two common approaches to using Lasso for non-linear regression:
Feature Engineering: One way to apply Lasso to non-linear regression problems is to create new features through feature engineering. By transforming or combining the original features, you can introduce non-linearity into the model.

Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression? 
Ridge Regression vs. Lasso: Both ridge and Lasso regression add regularization terms, but they use different regularization techniques. Ridge uses L2 regularization (sum of squared coefficients), which shrinks all coefficients towards zero but doesn't set them exactly to zero. Lasso uses L1 regularization (sum of absolute coefficients), which can lead to sparse models with exact zeros for some coefficients.
Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how? 
Lasso Regression has a built-in capability to address multicollinearity to some extent, although it does so indirectly through its feature selection mechanism. Here's how Lasso handles multicollinearity:
Feature Selection: Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it tends to drive the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero. When multicollinearity exists in the input features, it means that some features are highly correlated with others, making it challenging to distinguish their individual contributions to the target variable.
Reduction in the Number of Features: Multicollinearity often leads to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates in linear regression. Lasso's feature selection process helps mitigate this issue by effectively excluding one or more correlated features from the model. As a result, it simplifies the model and reduces the risk of multicollinearity.
Identification of Dominant Features: Lasso tends to retain only one of the correlated features while setting the coefficients of others to zero. The feature that remains in the model is typically the one that has a stronger impact on the target variable. This can help identify the most influential features in the presence of multicollinearity.

Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression? 
Final Model: Train a final Lasso Regression model using the selected optimal lambda value on the entire dataset (all folds combined).
Average Performance: Calculate the average performance metric (e.g., mean squared error) across all folds for each lambda value.
Range of Lambda Values: Start by defining a range of lambda values that you want to explore. This range should span a wide spectrum, from very small values (no or weak regularization) to very large values (strong regularization). The choice of the range depends on your specific problem and dataset.
Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a widely used technique to choose the best lambda value. The most common method is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is split into k subsets (folds), and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set.
